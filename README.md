Portfolio Reflection
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure my code is functional by writing detailed unit tests, like I did using JUnit in my ContactService project. I test both correct and incorrect inputs to make sure all cases are handled properly. To keep my code secure, I validate all user inputs and make sure that invalid or unexpected data cannot cause crashes or vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I read through the software requirements carefully and use them to guide my design choices. For example, when building the ContactService, I made sure fields like the contact ID, name, and phone number had length and null restrictions that matched the user requirements. I also wrote unit tests to confirm the system behaved exactly the way the users would expect.

How do I approach designing software?
When I design software, I break down the project into smaller pieces and create services for each part, like ContactService and TaskService. I use UML diagrams to plan how everything fits together, and I make sure that my classes and methods are easy to test and maintain. I also think ahead about possible errors and plan my code to handle them cleanly and safely.
