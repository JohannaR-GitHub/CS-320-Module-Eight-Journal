Portfolio Reflection
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure that my code is functional by writing detailed unit tests, like the ones I created in the ContactService project using JUnit. I tested both valid and invalid inputs to confirm that all parts of the program work correctly and handle errors properly. To help keep my software secure, I validate all user inputs, check for null or invalid values, and make sure that sensitive data is handled carefully.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by reviewing all requirements carefully and designing my code to meet those needs directly. For example, in my ContactService class, I made sure that fields like the contact ID, name, and phone number followed the restrictions listed in the requirements. I also created unit tests to make sure that the system would throw exceptions when invalid input was provided, which matches the behavior users expect from a reliable system.

How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I break down the requirements into smaller tasks and build classes and services that focus on specific jobs. I use UML diagrams to map out how different parts of the program should interact. For example, in my DriverPass system design, I used diagrams to plan the user flow and major system operations. I also design my code to be easy to test and maintain, thinking ahead about possible edge cases and how future updates might affect the system.
